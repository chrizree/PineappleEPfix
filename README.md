# PineappleEPfix

A simple workaround for problems when getting internet connection errors when trying to download dependencies when using the Evil Portal module on the Hak5 WiFi Pineapple Mark VII. It's not a fix, it's just a way to circumvent these kinds of problems that seem to occur for some users. There has been no analysis what so ever if this way of going forward has some negative side effects in using the Evil Portal module. Further investigation might be needed, but it most likely will show if ppl are using this workaround.

Note! The script file hasn't been tested on a Pineapple, it's created from the steps described in the wiki. It should work, but (as said) hasn't been verified.
